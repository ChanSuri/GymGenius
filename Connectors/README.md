# Raspberry Pi Connector
The Raspberry Pi Connector is a Device Connector that integrates into the platform Raspberry Pi boards. The Raspberry has temperature and humidity sensors to provide environmental information about the building's condition, InfraReds to also detect the occupancy of a specific machine, and push buttons to monitor the entrance and exits of the gym as well. It offers Rest Web Services for obtaining all that information. On top of that, it is equipped with two relays to switch on and off the connected appliances and provides Rest Web Services to retrieve and change the status of the connected appliances (on/off).
Furthermore, it functions both as an MQTT publisher and subscriber. The first function is used to transmit environmental data every five minutes as well as user presence information (when detected), while the second one is integrated to receive actuation commands from other actors that also exploit the MQTT protocol (e.g. Control Strategies). In particular, many RPIs as many rooms can be used to make the platform scalable. The standard design of the gym is made of the entrance, the changing rooms, and activities rooms, where different sensors are used based on different needs (temperature/humidity sensors
and push buttons, temperature sensors, temperature/humidity sensors, and InfraReds respectively)

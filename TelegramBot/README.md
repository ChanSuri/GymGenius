# Telebot
Telegram Bot is a service that connects the proposed infrastructure to the cloud-based instant messaging platform Telegram. It makes use of the REST Web Services offered by the Raspberry Pi connector to retrieve measurements from the devices of the platform. Additionally, again exploiting REST, it enables users to retrieve historical and real-time data from the Thingspeak platform and the Thingspeak adaptor, respectively. Moreover, it works both as an MQTT publisher and an MQTT subscriber to let the user send actuation commands and retrieve alerts.

## Method
> MQTT subscribe and publish with topic
> REST: HTTP with JSON
